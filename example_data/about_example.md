# About the example image pair: Spatial metabolomics

The example image pair shows two light microscopy mosaics of an area on a glass slide that has been used in a spatial metabolomics experiment.

The first image (`preMaldi.jpg`) shows cells on a glass slight in brightfield mode, prior to MALDI imaging. 

The second image (`postMaldi.jpg`) shows roughly the same area of the slide after MALDI imaging. For MALDI imaging the slide has been coated with Matrix that facilitates ionization and then placed in a MALDI imager. Individual spots have been ablated an ionized with a laser and analysed with a mass spectrometer. In order to link the mass spectrometry data from a particular ablation mark to corresponding cells, accurate registration is a prerequisite. (In most cases this happens fully automatically, only rarely a manual workflow as outlined here is required).
